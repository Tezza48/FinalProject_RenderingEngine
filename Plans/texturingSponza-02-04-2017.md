# Rendering the sponza scene

The goal of this task is to finally render the sponza scene with all of the correct textures (diffuse currently)
To achieve this goal i will need to export the individual meshes from the scene as i currently cannot retrive the textures using the FBX.

## Tasks
 * Convert any Multi Sub-object materials into atlases
 * Export and name individual meshes
 * Match textures/atlases with their mesh counterparts
 * import the meshes into the rendering engine
 * import the textures into the engine
 * Render
